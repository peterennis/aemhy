# boot

This tool will let you initialize codebase from a template.

## Usage

```bash
mhy boot [technology:react|vue|...] [template:default|...] [-o,--output: output path]
```

* `technology`: what tech should be used.
  * `default`: react
* `template`: what template should be loaded.
  * `default`: default
* `-o, --output`: path where the template should be boot.
  * `default`: ''

Examples:

```bash
mhy boot react default -o myProject
# or
mhy boot
# or
mhy boot react
# or
mhy boot -o xproject/path/src
```

> Your `package.json` will be extended with the necessary changes you might need to run the template. If it doesn't exists, it'll be created for you.

## Available Templates

```sh
